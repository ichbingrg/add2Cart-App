# add2Cart-App
My first time using firebase. This is a web app where one can create list of things to be bought from store. This app is using firebase for database

# The app has been deployed on netlify
https://add2cart-sudip.netlify.app/

You can click on the item to delete the item. The app is also mobile friendly and can be easily used on phones.
It is designed to be added to homescreen and be used as an app.
